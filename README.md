# What?

The goal of this project is to package [sentry](http://getsentry.com)
as a debian package. It leverages
[dh-virtualenv](https://github.com/spotify/dh-virtualenv) to perform
the actual work. The primary OS target is debian 8 "jessie"; It might
or might not work on other debian and debian based systems.
